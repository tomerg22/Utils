/* Decide how far to trust a page read: 'clear', 'blocked', or 'suspect'.
 *
 * WHY 'suspect' EXISTS (measured 2026-08-25, the jump-starter session)
 * The old check was a boolean over two LOUD markers: a punish URL, or
 * `nc_1_nocaptcha` / `Captcha Interception` in the text. A real wall arrived
 * in a quieter form and walked straight through it. Detail pages returned
 * 279,005 bytes of HTML with 957 bytes of rendered body text and ZERO
 * JSON-LD nodes. No marker matched that shape. The operator read the empty
 * body, reported "Not a wall — a rendering fault", and then built a whole
 * product comparison on top of that false negative, including telling the
 * user a review count was "not obtainable" when the page in fact held 1,633.
 *
 * Three rules come out of it, and all three are encoded below.
 *
 * 1. CONTENT IS THE ONLY PROOF OF NO-WALL. A wall's defining property is
 *    that it withholds content. So if data actually came back, say clear and
 *    stop worrying. If NOTHING came back, you do not get to assume why.
 *    This ordering is what keeps the check quiet: it cannot fire on a page
 *    that served you.
 *
 * 2. A QUIET MARKER IS NEVER DISMISSIBLE. In that session `punish` appeared
 *    in the HTML, the operator invented a reason it did not count ("standard
 *    anti-bot SDK, ships on normal pages") and never ran one command to
 *    check that. Constructing the explanation IS the failure mode. Here it
 *    returns 'suspect' and there is no argument that clears it except a
 *    check.
 *
 * 3. TEXT CANNOT SETTLE THIS — ONLY LOOKING CAN. A stalled render and an
 *    interstitial are identical from the text channel. Scraping harder will
 *    never separate them. That is why `note` mandates a screenshot: one call
 *    ends the ambiguity. This is the skill's own "one channel drew a blank
 *    and the blank was treated as a finding" defect, applied at last to
 *    block detection instead of only to product specs.
 *
 * signals:
 *   url        final URL after redirects
 *   text       rendered body text (document.body.innerText), or fetched body
 *   html       document.documentElement.outerHTML, or the fetched HTML, or ''
 *   dataNodes  count of usable data carriers found (JSON-LD scripts, an
 *              init-data anchor, parsed items). 0 means "nothing usable".
 *
 * NOT-A-WALL is still returned for a page that plainly is not an interstitial
 * — a short malformed response with no wall markers is a parse error, and
 * naming it that is more useful than crying wolf. 'suspect' fires only on
 * POSITIVE evidence, so it stays rare enough to be worth acting on.
